# Uselessness-of-process
A means of deciding if a process is useless

# Background
Every software can be classified under various metrics which evaluate their usefulness in a software development environment e.g. There's Gartner's method of Function Point analysis (and subsequently the magic quadrant), Forrester wave (used by majority of the industry along with Gartner FFPA), Whale Path(Siemens, Credit Suisse, Panasonic, Disney), Capterra (Coca-Cola, Walmart, Warner Brothers, The Home Depot) and many more along the same lines.<br/>
In a sample Agile (Scrum) environment like HSBC Software Development India, it has been observed that ever so often, processes are added on to serve a certain function at that point but then later forgotten about or never updated with the trends of technology prevailing in the industry. This eventually leads to a large number of unnecessary/obsolete process in the software development model.<br/>
This excel workbook aims at creating a sample "process evaluator" that attempts to determine if a certain step in the software development life cycle can be deemed unnecessary and removed. Unlike the other metrics, this one looks at steps individually. Also, unlike the other metrics which tend to foster an environment where processes are added, this one fosters an environment where processes are removed from the development life cycle of a Code.<br/>
